Librarian is a utility for scanning a collection of audio files on
disk and importing their tag data into a database. 

Librarian uses the ruby wrapper for taglib
(http://rtaglib.rubyforge.org/) to parse tags in mp3, flac & ogg
files. Tag data is extracted to a single unnormalized table with these
columns: path, file, album, artist, title, genre, year, track.

This project is currently in-development / unfinished.
