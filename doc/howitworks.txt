Librarian does these things:

TODO--Add a Repository 
TODO--Update a Repository


--Verify Recordings (check that everything in the db still exists on disk, delete bad entries)
  Example: script/verify_recordings.rb


--Scan a Directory (takes an arbitrary dir and scans it for new recordings)
  Example:  script/scan_files.rb /home/jacob/music/


--Add a Recording (imports a file to the db as a possibly new recording)
  Example: script/scan_file.rb /home/jacob/music/some-recording-artist/some-album/01_-_Mississippi.ogg


--Search for a recording
  Example: script/search.rb artist 'freaky flow'
  Example: script/search.rb album 'Obscene Underground'
  Example: script/search.rb title "he's a flirt"
  Example: script/search.rb file techno


FUTURE PLANS

--Convert recording (generates preview copies of a file)

  Let's say the directory structure has the  source file at: REPOSITORY_ROOT/Incoming/my-album/001-intro (short version).WAV

  Convert generates a converted version in a hidden directory, 
    ".mp3", holding reduced-size mp3 previews for portable players. 

  The mp3 would be located as follows: REPOSITORY_ROOT/Recordings/my-album/.mp3/001-intro (short version).mp3
