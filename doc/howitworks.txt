Librarian does these things:

--Query Dir (takes an arbitrary dir and scans it for new recordings)

--Add recording (imports a file to the db as a (possibly) new recording)


--Update (check dir INCOMING)    
  Hook this up to a cron job at 5 minute intervals.


--Search for a recording

--Get a download link to a recording



--Convert recording (generates preview copies of a file)

  Let's say the directory structure has the  source file at: REPOSITORY_ROOT/Incoming/my-album/001-intro (short version).WAV

  Convert generates a converted version in a hidden directory, 
    ".mp3", holding reduced-size mp3 previews for portable players. 

  The mp3 would be located as follows: REPOSITORY_ROOT/Recordings/my-album/.mp3/001-intro (short version).mp3
